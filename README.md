## About The Project ðŸŽ®

This is a clone of the classic PlayStation One homepage, recreated to bring back that nostalgic 90s gaming vibe.  
You can explore the original layout with menus, game previews, and cool retro graphics.  
Itâ€™s designed to look just like the real thing, down to the fonts and colors.  
The site works well on both desktop and mobile, so you can enjoy the throwback anywhere.  
Itâ€™s a fun project for anyone who loves old-school gaming or wants to practice building pixel-perfect UIs.  
Navigation is simple and intuitive, just like the original PlayStation site.  
The project also shows how to recreate vintage designs using modern web tools.  
Great for fans of PlayStation history or web developers interested in UI cloning.  
Itâ€™s not a fully functional store, but it captures the style and feel perfectly.  
Perfect if you want a nostalgic trip or a portfolio piece showing attention to detail.
