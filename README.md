# About The Project ðŸŽ®

This is a recreation of the original PlayStation One homepage, bringing back those classic 90s gaming vibes.  
You can check out the old-school layout, menus, and game previews just like on the real site.  
Itâ€™s designed to look and feel authentic, with all the retro fonts and colors.  
The site works smoothly on both desktop and mobile, so you can enjoy the nostalgia anywhere.  
Itâ€™s a fun little project for anyone who loves vintage gaming or wants to practice building pixel-perfect designs.  
Navigating the site feels just like the original, simple and straightforward.  
Itâ€™s a cool way to see how you can use modern web tools to recreate old-school styles.  
This isnâ€™t a real store or functional site, but it nails the look and feel perfectly.  
If youâ€™re a PlayStation fan or just love retro web design, this project is for you.  
A nice throwback and a solid portfolio piece showing attention to detail.
